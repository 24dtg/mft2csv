#summary A command line file information dumper.

= Introduction =

This tool will decode the $MFT record for a given file. It is a combination of mft2csv and NtfsFileExtracter. That means it is a tool for quick decode and dumping of file records. It does not write any csv, but dumps the information to the console. It is very handy when testing stuff and learning NTFS, as you can do stuff to a file and get it decoded right away, without first having to extract the whole $MFT and then decode it to a csv, before importing it into Excel or something and get the actual result. MFTRCRD is therefore for quick dumping of record information for individual files, wheeras mft2csv is for decoding the complete $MFT with all its records, which may be a substantial amount and timeconsuming task.
