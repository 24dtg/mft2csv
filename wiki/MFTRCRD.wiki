#summary A command line $MFT record dumper and decoder.

= Introduction =

This tool will decode the $MFT record for a given file. It is a combination of mft2csv and NtfsFileExtracter. That means it is a tool for quick decode and dumping of file records. It does not write any csv, but dumps the information to the console. It is very handy when testing stuff and learning NTFS, as you can do stuff to a file and get it decoded right away, without first having to extract the whole $MFT and then decode it to a csv, before importing it into Excel or something and get the actual result. MFTRCRD is therefore for quick dumping of record information for individual files, whereas mft2csv is for decoding the complete $MFT with all its records, which may be a substantial amount and timeconsuming task.

It supports both file name+path and IndexNumber (MFT record) as input. Also choose between 2 switches. One to dump the core decode, and one to also dump a formatted hex dump of the record, the present attributes, record slack and core attribute list. Also it will display detailed runs information (removed in v1007), so you can easily trace the various file fragments on the disk. 

For most usage, set param3 as attriblist_off. That will produce faster output. Only set param3 as attriblist_on when there is an $ATTRIBUTE_LIST attribute present.

Attributes currently handled:
  * $STANDARD_INFORMATION
  * $ATTRIBUTE_LIST
  * $FILE_NAME
  * $OBJECT_ID
  * $SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR (just raw hex dump)
  * $VOLUME_NAME
  * $VOLUME_INFORMATION
  * $DATA
  * $INDEX_ROOT
  * $INDEX_ALLOCATION
  * $BITMAP (just raw hex dump)
  * $REPARSE_POINT
  * $EA_INFORMATION
  * $EA
  * $LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM

= How to run MFTRCRD =

It is command line and the syntax is:

=== Usage: "MFTRCRD param1 param2 param3" ===

param1 can be a valid file path or an IndexNumber ($MFT record number)

param2 can be -d or -a:
-d means just decode $MFT entry
-a same as -d but also dumps the whole $MFT entry to console

param3 is for optimizing speed of processing and can be either attriblist_on or attriblist_off. attriblist_on is for faster processing when $ATTRIBUTE_LIST is present.

=== Example for dumping an $MFT decode for boot.ini: ===

MFTRCRD C:\boot.ini -d attriblist_off

=== Example for dumping an $MFT decode + a 1024 byte $MFT record dump for $MFT itself from the C: drive: ===

MFTRCRD C:0 -a attriblist_off

=== Example for dumping an $MFT decode for $LogFile from the D: drive: ===

MFTRCRD D:2 -d attriblist_off

=== Example for dumping a speed optimized $MFT decode for an extremely fragmented file with $ATTRIBUTE_LIST present: ===

MFTRCRD C:\ExtremelyFragmented.bin -d attriblist_on


= Latest version =
v1.0.0.10

= Changelog =

v1.0.0.10: Added test decode of $INDEX_ROOT and $INDEX_ALLOCATION. Added INDX record decoding and raw hex dump.

v1009: Added decoding of resident and nonresident $REPARSE_POINT, $EA_INFORMATION, $EA and $LOGGED_UTILITY_STREAM. Added an extra switch to speed up $MFT processing when $ATTRIBUTE_LIST is present/not present. Fixed an extra error in the raw hex dump of $EA.

v1008: Now hexdumps of all attributes are displayed with the -a switch, and not just the ones that are decoded.

v1007: Switched code base to the same as of NTFS File Extracter. Now full $ATTRIBUTE_LIST is decoded and resolved. A pregeneration of an internal $MFT array is added to substantially speed up decoding of files with attribute list. Added raw dump of record slack.
